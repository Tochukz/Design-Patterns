### Introduction 
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers face in software development.  
These solutios were obtained by trial and error by numerioud software developers over quite a substantial period of time.  
According to the authors of the _Gang of Four(GOF)_, design patterns are primarily based on the following principles of object orientaed desing:  
* Program to an interface not an implementation 
* Favor object composition over inheritance.  

__Usage of Desing Pattern__    
Desing pattern have tow main usages:  
1. __Common platform for developers:__ They provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario.  
2. __Best Practices:__ They provide the best solutions 

__Types of Design Patterns__   
There are 23 desing patterns which canbe classified in three categories:  
1. __Creational Patterns:__ They provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic , rather than instantiating object directly using new operator.      
2. __Structural Patterns:__  They are concerned with class and object composition and inheritance.  
3. __Behavioral Patterns:__ They are conerned with communication between objects.  
4. __J2EE Patterns:__  They are concerned with presentation tier. They are identified by the _Sun Java Center_.
